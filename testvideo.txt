Honeslty I don't know what I'm doing
Knowing me I will fail this just like I've been doing all semestar
probably didn't spell semester correctly
I am tired of everything,
guess it's kind of easy when "everything" revolves around me
I make no promises of change or improvements, I will no longer brag what I'll do t improve,
my words are empty, 
this is all about me, no one else is involved.
no one needs to know that I'm trying to improve
no one even needs to know that I did improve
because if I tell them thtat I will
and I don't
all that's left is regret that will keep repeating itself
so all I can do
all that I will do
is just 
go on I guess
